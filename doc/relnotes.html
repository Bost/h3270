      <h1>Release Notes</h1>
      <font color="#ff8c00"><b>h3270 version 1.2-pre1</b></font> is a
      pre-release of the upcoming version 1.2.
      <p>
      The most important change is that the character-based emulation
      mode now supports <b>colors and multi-line input fields</b>.
      The color model is implied by the basic field attributes: There
      can be a different color for protected/unprotected, and
      normal/intensified/hidden fields, leading to six different
      combinations.  There is a new Preference dialog that allows you
      to choose between different color schemes.  At the moment, we
      have defined four of them (<i>White Background</i>
      (default), <i>Dark Background</i>, <i>Amber</i>, and <i>Black
      and White</i>).  You could also define your own color schemes,
      but that has to be done in the code for now
      (see <code>org.h3270.render.Configuration</code>).
      <p>
      Since the data model inside h3270 changed quite a bit for these
      new features, we're making it available as a pre-release first,
      to give people of chance of checking it out and report any
      problems back to us.
      <p>
      Apart from these changes, a few important bugs were fixed.  The
      most critical one of those was a problem under Internet
      Explorer, which would send two identical requests in a row when
      ENTER was pressed.  Depending on the timing of the connection,
      this could cause h3270 to throw
      an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>.  This has now been
      fixed.
      <p>
      <font color="#ff8c00"><b>h3270 version 1.1</b></font> is a
      maintenance release that contains the following new features:
      <ul>
        <li>All PC function keys are now passed to h3270 (some
          of them used to be intercepted by the browser or
          operating system).</li>
        <li>Support for hidden, unmodifiable fields has been
          added.</li>
        <li>The standard z/OS login screen can now be handled by
          h3270 (it contains a multiline field which we couldn't
          deal with before).  There is no full support for multiline
          fields yet, but we plan that for the next release.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      <font color="#ff8c00"><b>h3270 version 1.0</b></font> is the
      first public release of the program.  It has already been tested
      in real-world settings, and we consider it to be of production
      quality.  In particular:
      <ul>
        <li>The simple, character-based layout (see <a
        href="screenshots.html">screenshots</a>) works out of the box
        and has proven sufficient to operate several actual mainframe
        applications.</li>
        <li>The regex-based rendering engine can be used to turn host
        screens into interfaces that look and feel like real web
        applications.</li>
      </ul>
      We consider this only the beginning, though.  Improvements
      planned for future releases include:
      <ul>
        <li>Add Portlet frontends so that h3270 can be used within a
        portal server such as Jetspeed.</li>
        <li>Enhancements in the rendering engine.  One idea is to
        develop algorithms that can detect tabular structures within
        host screens and render them in a change-tolerant way (which
        means that changes in the underlying screens, such as adding a
        new field or changing a field label, are immediately reflected
        in the HTML version).  Another enhancement is to add
        mechanisms for drop-down lists, context-sensitive help, and
        link-based navigation.</li>
        <li>Full support for colors and other text attributes in the
        simple, character-based display mode.</li>
      </ul>
