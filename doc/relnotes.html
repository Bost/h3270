      <h1>Release Notes</h1>

      <font color="#ff8c00"><b>h3270 version 1.3.2</b></font> adds the
      ability to have <b>multiple h3270 sessions</b> open at the same
      time, from the same browser.  This works both in the servlet
      version and the portlet version.
      <p>
      In order to support this, the keyboard handling model had to be
      changed.  Key handlers are no longer attached to the entire
      page, but to each of the input fields on a screen individually.
      One consequence is that you can only submit a screen back to the
      host if the cursor is currently in one of that screen's input
      fields.  If the screen has no input fields at all, the only way
      to submit it would be to enable and use the HTML keypad.
      <p>
      If people are having trouble with this, please let us know and
      we can try and work out a different solution.
      <p>

      <font color="#ff8c00"><b>h3270 version 1.3</b></font> introduces
      the following changes:
      <ul>
        <li>There is now a <b>JSR-168 Portlet</b> available.  To use
        it, you must build h3270 with the portlet API jar file
        available.  You can then package h3270 into a war file as
        usual, and install it in any JSR-168 portlet container.
        Further details on this process are given in the installation
        guide.  One restriction of the portlet is that you can only
        have a <i>single instance</i> of it on a page right now.  This is
        because the keyboard handling code is not yet adapted to the
        portal model, where multiple portlets on a page might be
        interested in key events.  We are working to resolve this.
        </li>

        <li>In the new <code>contrib</code> directory, you can find
        code that we used to run h3270 as an <b>IView</b> in the <b>SAP portal
        server</b>.  It is not yet adapted to the current version of
        h3270, but may be useful as a starting point for some
        people.  We are working to improve this code and expect to
        provide full IView support in a future release.</li>

        <li>The default location where h3270 tries to find the s3270
        binary has been changed to <code>/usr/local/bin</code>.  We no
        longer use the <code>bin</code> directory in the web
        application, because it is really wrong to put a
        platform-specific binary in that place.</li>

        <li>The structure of the configuration
        file <code>h3270-config.xml</code> has changed slightly.
        Please see the copy of the file in the current release for
        details.</li>

        <li>Several small bugs and layout issues have been fixed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      
      <font color="#ff8c00"><b>h3270 version 1.2.3</b></font>
      fixes a few layout issues and includes updated documentation.
      You can now restrict h3270 so that users can only connect to a
      single host with it.  To do this, set the new <b>target-host</b>
      parameter in <code>webapp/WEB-INF/h3270-config.xml</code>.
      
      <p>
      
      <font color="#ff8c00"><b>h3270 version 1.2.2</b></font>
      properly ignores extended attributes (which we don't support
      yet).  Several other bugs have been fixed, the build process
      has been streamlined, and the documentation has been updated.
      
      <p>
      
      <font color="#ff8c00"><b>h3270 version 1.2.1</b></font> fixes a bug which made it impossible to use h3270 under some tomcat versions.
      
      <p>
      
      <font color="#ff8c00"><b>h3270 version 1.2</b></font> is a
      maintenance release that contains the following new features:
      <ul>
        <li>A new configuration mechanism. The definition of color
        schemes, fonts, etc. has been moved to a XML configuration
        file (see <code>webapp/WEB-INF/h3270-config.xml</code>).
        
        <li>The User Preferences (colorscheme, font, etc.) are now
        stored in a client-side cookie.

        <li>It's possible to customize the appearance of
        h3270. Uncomment the property <code>style</code>
        (see <code>h3270-config.xml</code>) for an example.

        <li>h3270 now uses commons-logging as logging toolkit.
      </ul>
      Apart from these Changes some minor bugs were fixed.
      <p>
      <font color="#ff8c00"><b>h3270 version 1.2-pre1</b></font> is a
      pre-release of the upcoming version 1.2.
      <p>
      The most important change is that the character-based emulation
      mode now supports <b>colors and multi-line input fields</b>.
      The color model is implied by the basic field attributes: There
      can be a different color for protected/unprotected, and
      normal/intensified/hidden fields, leading to six different
      combinations.  There is a new Preference dialog that allows you
      to choose between different color schemes.  At the moment, we
      have defined four of them (<i>White Background</i>
      (default), <i>Dark Background</i>, <i>Amber</i>, and <i>Black
      and White</i>).  You could also define your own color schemes,
      but that has to be done in the code for now
      (see <code>org.h3270.render.Configuration</code>).
      <p>
      Since the data model inside h3270 changed quite a bit for these
      new features, we're making it available as a pre-release first,
      to give people of chance of checking it out and report any
      problems back to us.
      <p>
      Apart from these changes, a few important bugs were fixed.  The
      most critical one of those was a problem under Internet
      Explorer, which would send two identical requests in a row when
      ENTER was pressed.  Depending on the timing of the connection,
      this could cause h3270 to throw
      an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>.  This has now been
      fixed.
      <p>
      <font color="#ff8c00"><b>h3270 version 1.1</b></font> is a
      maintenance release that contains the following new features:
      <ul>
        <li>All PC function keys are now passed to h3270 (some
          of them used to be intercepted by the browser or
          operating system).</li>
        <li>Support for hidden, unmodifiable fields has been
          added.</li>
        <li>The standard z/OS login screen can now be handled by
          h3270 (it contains a multiline field which we couldn't
          deal with before).  There is no full support for multiline
          fields yet, but we plan that for the next release.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      <font color="#ff8c00"><b>h3270 version 1.0</b></font> is the
      first public release of the program.  It has already been tested
      in real-world settings, and we consider it to be of production
      quality.  In particular:
      <ul>
        <li>The simple, character-based layout (see <a
        href="screenshots.html">screenshots</a>) works out of the box
        and has proven sufficient to operate several actual mainframe
        applications.</li>
        <li>The regex-based rendering engine can be used to turn host
        screens into interfaces that look and feel like real web
        applications.</li>
      </ul>
      We consider this only the beginning, though.  Improvements
      planned for future releases include:
      <ul>
        <li>Add Portlet frontends so that h3270 can be used within a
        portal server such as Jetspeed.</li>
        <li>Enhancements in the rendering engine.  One idea is to
        develop algorithms that can detect tabular structures within
        host screens and render them in a change-tolerant way (which
        means that changes in the underlying screens, such as adding a
        new field or changing a field label, are immediately reflected
        in the HTML version).  Another enhancement is to add
        mechanisms for drop-down lists, context-sensitive help, and
        link-based navigation.</li>
        <li>Full support for colors and other text attributes in the
        simple, character-based display mode.</li>
      </ul>
