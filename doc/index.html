      <b><font color="#ff8c00">h3270</font> is a program that allows you to
      use IBM 3270 hosts from within a web browser.  It is different
      from other, similar systems because of its highly configurable
      layout engine that is based on regular expressions.</b>
      <p>
      Classical mainframe applications are still part of the IT
      infrastructure of most large enterprises.  The challenge is
      often to integrate them with more recent, browser-based systems.
      <font color="#ff8c00"><b>h3270</b></font> allows you to do that
      in two steps:
      <ul>
        <li>It renders 3270 host screens in HTML and makes them
        operable from within a web browser. This process works out of
        the box in a simple, character-based layout that resembles the
        original terminal screen. Optionally, the layout can be
        enhanced using a configurable engine so that it looks and
        feels like a real web application.</li>
        <p>
        <li>The HTML adapter is available both as a servlet and a
        portlet, so that it can be used either as a stand-alone web
        application, or inside a portal server, which allows for
        seamless integration with other applications at the user
        interface level.</li>
      </ul>
      <font color="#ff8c00"><b>h3270</b></font> is a server-side Java
      application that is compliant with the J2EE standard and the
      Portlet API (JSR-168).  To access the 3270 data
      stream, it uses the <a
      href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Peaks/7814/">s3270</a>
      program written by Paul Mattes, which in turn relies on the
      TN3270 format to access the host via Telnet (TCP/IP).
      <p>

      further technical information about
      <font color="#ff8c00"><b>h3270</b></font> is available.

          The generated HTML should now be XHTML-compliant.  Several

          released.<p>  The most notable change is that h3270 now
          comes with a <b>portlet</b> that is compliant with
          the <b>JSR-168 Portlet API</b>.  You can deploy it to any
          compliant portal server such as Jetspeed or the IBM
          WebSphere Portal Server.  We are also working on an
          h3270 <b>IView</b> for the <b>SAP Portal Server</b>, and
          provide some alpha-quality code for it in the current
          release.  The original stand-alone web application continues
          to exist as well.  For details, please see

          is a small new feature that may be interesting for many
          users: You can now restrict h3270 so that users can only
          connect to a single host with it.  See

          1.2-pre1</b></font> released.<p>Since our initial release in
          December, we've learned that many people are happy with the
          character-based terminal emulation of h3270.  They have no
          need for the more advanced, regex-based rendering engine.
          So we have spent some more work on the character-based mode,
          to make it behave like a real terminal emulator.  This
          release adds the most crucial missing pieces: <b>support for
          colors and multi-line input fields</b> (see the <a
          href="relnotes.html">release notes</a> for details).
          <p>
          This is a prelease of the upcoming version 1.2.  Since the
          data model inside h3270 changed considerably, we felt
          that people should be able to give it a try first, before
          we make the full release of 1.2.
          <p>
          Enjoy, and let us know what you think.  The best forum for
          this is the h3270-devel mailing list.  (Subscription link

          released.<p>Our first release in December really attracted
          a small but growing community around h3270.  Due to a lot
          of positive feedback, version 1.1 is a maintenance release
          that contains some minor new features mostly suggested by
          users.  This includes:
            <ul>
              <li>All PC function keys are now passed to h3270 (some
              of them used to be intercepted by the browser or
              operating system).</li>
              <li>Support for hidden, unmodifiable fields has been
              added.</li>
              <li>The standard z/OS login screen can now be handled by
              h3270 (it contains a multiline field which we couldn't
              deal with before).  There is no full support for multiline
              fields yet, but we plan that for the next release.</li>
            </ul>
          Enjoy, and please keep that feedback coming!
