      <h1>User Guide</h1>

      h3270 is available as both a stand-alone web application (a
      servlet) and a portlet for use in a portlet container.  We will
      first describe how to use the stand-alone web application, then
      how the portlet interface differs from this.
      <p>
      By default, h3270 provides a generic terminal emulation
      interface.  You can use it to connect to any host that is
      reachable from the machine on which h3270 runs via TCP/IP.  In
      our example, we assume that h3270 runs in a default Tomcat
      installation on the local machine.  The address to use in the
      browser window is
      <code>http://localhost:8080/h3270/servlet</code>.  When you
      enter this address and hit return, the generic connect screen
      as shown in fig.&nbsp;1 is displayed.

        <p>

      </center>
      <p>
      In the input field at the lower left corner, enter the DNS
      address of the host you want to connect to.  You can either
      press ENTER or push the "Connect" button on the lower right to
      let h3270 connect to the indicated host.  If the connection can
      be established, the login screen of the specified host should
      appear, as shown in fig.&nbsp;2.  (For this particular host
      screen, we have defined a rendering template to make it look
      pretty.  Normally, if h3270 doesn't know anything about the host
      you connect to, you will see a simple, character-based layout.)

      </center>
      <p>
      You can operate the host application from within the browser
      window very much the same as you would do in an ordinary
      terminal or emulator.  You can use the mouse or keyboard to
      place the cursor into the input field you want to make changes
      to, and press ENTER to send your modified fields back to the
      host.
      <p>
      Please note: The HTML-based input fields that h3270 uses work
      somewhat differently than what you may know from traditional
      terminals and emulators.  For example, 3270 terminals usually
      operate in <i>overwrite mode</i>, so what you type replaces the
      original contents of the field key by key.  Many host
      applications make use of this by prefilling input fields with
      underscores, and the like.  Unfortunately, there is no such
      overwrite mode available for HTML input fields.  We have not
      completely settled on a way to handle this nicely in h3270.  For
      the time being, our approach is to remove leading and trailing
      blanks, underscores, and NUL characters from the contents of
      input fields when we display them.  As a special case, this
      means when a field contains <i>only</i> blanks, underscores, or
      NUL characters, it will start out completely empty in HTML.
      This allows for convenient input from within the browser, but
      may cause problems with the underlying host application in some
      circumstances.  This particular area should be considered work
      in progress.
      <p>
      Many host applications also make extensive use of function keys
      (such as PF7 and PA1).  h3270 uses the function
      keys of your keyboard (F1-12 on traditional PC keyboards) for
      PF1-12.  Any events from these function keys are handled so that
      the h3270 web application receives them, rather than the
      browser or the operating system (this is a new feature since
      h3270 version 1.1).  You can also press the button in the lower right
      corner of the page to display an auxiliary keypad beneath your
      application (see fig.&nbsp;3).

        <p>
        Fig. 3: Keypad Enabled
      </center>
      <p>
      Some of the keys on this keypad are not implemented yet, partly
      because they do not really make sense in an HTML interface.  All
      the function keys (PFx and PAx) do work, however (although
      PF13-24 are still missing).  The keypad in its current form is
      therefore only a starting point which probably must be tailored
      to the particular needs of your application (this does require
      programming within h3270).
      <p>
      The meaning of the other buttons at the bottom of the page
      (next to the "Keypad" button) is as follows:
      <dl>
        <dt><b>Disconnect</b></dt>
        <dd>
          Disconnects h3270 from the host and returns to the initial
          screen (fig.&nbsp;1).
        </dd>
        <p>
        <dt><b>Refresh</b></dt>
        <dd>
          Refreshes the HTML page from the screen buffer within h3270.
          This does not send any data to the host.  However, this
          currently is the only way to see any changes that the host
          may have sent to h3270 after the page was initially
          displayed (we're considering to use server-side push to make
          this automatic).
        </dd>
        <p>
        <dt><b>Dump</b></dt>
        <dd>
          Writes a dump of the current screen buffer contents to a
          file.  Pressing this button opens a dialog where you can
          enter the file name.  The file is written to
          the <code>WEB-INF/dump</code> directory within the h3270 web
          application.  On the initial connect screen (fig.&nbsp;1),
          you can specify this filename prefixed
          with <code>file:</code> instead of a host to connect to.
          h3270 will then display this screen statically (you cannot
          interact with it in this mode).  This is useful for testing
          rendering templates without actually connecting to a host.
        </dd>
        <p>
        <dt><b>Preferences...</b></dt>
        <dd>
          Opens a separate window that allows you to configure several
          settings: the color scheme to use, the font for
          character-based rendering, and whether the regex-based
          rendering engine should be used (see
          the <a href="config.html">configuration guide</a> for
          details on programming this engine).

        </dd>
        <p>
        <dt><b>Keypad</b></dt>
        <dd>
          Toggles the auxiliary HTML keypad (see above).
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <h2>Using the Portlet</h2>
        The h3270 portlet is very similar to the stand-alone web
        application.  To use it, you (or an administrator) needs to
        place the portlet onto a portal page first (the name of the
        portlet is "H3270Portlet").  The portlet can
        be configured to connect to a fixed host automatically.  In
        this case, you needn't enter a host address yourself, it
        should come up with that host's start screen all by itself.
        To change the configuration, place the portlet into EDIT mode
        (usually by pressing a pencil-shaped icon in the portlet's
        titlebar).  The portlet then displays a screen similar to the
        preferences window of the web application.  You can enter the
        address of the target host on this screen, and change all the
        other settings as well.  Press "Connect" or "Disconnect" to
        connect or disconnect.  If you enable "Auto-Connect" mode,
        then the portlet will always try to remain connected with the
        target host whenever it is in VIEW mode.
