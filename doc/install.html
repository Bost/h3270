      <h1>Installation Instructions</h1>

      The h3270 program is a server to which clients connect using a
      web browser.  h3270 itself connects to the host using TCP/IP
      (Telnet).  In a standard scenario, h3270 is installed on a
      dedicated server machine, typically a Unix host or a Windows
      machine.  Nothing needs to be installed on the clients &mdash;
      all they need is a web browser.
      <p>
      If you just want to try out h3270, you can also install it right
      on your client machine, and use your web browser to connect to
      it locally.
      <p>
      We provide two kinds of files in
      our <a
      href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=95795">download
      area</a>: binary releases and source releases.  A <b>binary
      release</b> is ready to run on a specific platform.  All the
      parts of h3270 are pre-compiled and pre-configured.  A <b>source
      release</b> includes only the source code of the program.
      Before you can use it, you must compile h3270 and the components
      that it relies on yourself.  This allows you to use it even on
      platforms which we don't support with a binary release, and it
      also allows you to modify h3270 to suit your own needs.
      <p>
      For a given version X.Y.Z, the binary releases are named
      <p>
        <blockquote>
         <code>h3270-X.Y.Z-bin-linux.tar.gz</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;, or<br>
         <code>h3270-X.Y.Z-bin-windows.zip</code>
        </blockquote>
      <p>
      The source release is named
      <p>
        <blockquote>
         <code>h3270-X.Y.Z.tar.gz</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;, or<br>
         <code>h3270-X.Y.Z.zip</code>
        </blockquote>
      <p>
      Both of these files (.tar.gz and .zip) contain the same code,
      they are just compressed differently.  Choose whichever you can
      handle best on your platform.
      <p>
      Binary releases are very easy to install.  The top-level
      directory of the release, when you unpack it, contains a file
      README that contains installation instructions.  If you want to
      build h3270 from the source release, follow the instructions
      below, on the remainder of this page.

      <h1>Prerequisites for Building from Source</h1> 

      h3270 is a server-side Java application and therefore runs in
      any environment where Java is available.  s3270, on which h3270
      relies, is a C program that's easy to build and which runs under
      all major operating systems (we have tested this under GNU/Linux
      and Windows).
      <p>
      This is what you need in order to get h3270 up and running:
      <ul>
        <li>JDK 1.4 or higher.</li>
        <li>A J2EE-compliant web container.  Any version of <a
        href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat">Tomcat</a>, for
        example, will do (we have tested versions 3.3.1a, 4.1.29, and
        5.0.30).</li>
        <li>If you want to use h3270 as a portlet, you need a JSR-168
        compliant portal server.  We have tested this with Jetspeed
        2.0-M2, Liferay, and the IBM WebSphere Portal Server (WPS),
        but any other portal server should work as well.  We have also
        been successful to run h3270 as an IView within the SAP portal
        server, but have only experimental code for this yet.  You can
        find this code in the <code>contrib</code> directory.
        <li>The <a href="http://ant.apache.org">Ant</a> build tool.
        We've been using version 1.5.1, but any recent version should
        do.
        <li>The s3270 program to communicate with the host.  Because
        of a special feature that was added particularly for h3270,
        you need <a
        href="http://x3270.bgp.nu/download/s3270-latest.tgz">s3270
        version 3.3.1-alpha10</a> or higher.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Installation</h1>

      The following are the steps to install h3270.  In these
      instructions, we assume that you are using Tomcat version 4 or
      higher, but the instructions should apply to any other web
      container with only trivial changes.
      <ol class="installation-list">

        <li>Build and install Ant as described in its installation
        instructions.</li>

        <li>Build and install Tomcat as described in its installation
        instructions.  In the following, we refer to the directory
        where you installed Tomcat as <code>$TOMCAT_HOME</code>.</li>

        <li>Download and build s3270 according to its installation
        instructions.  Place the resulting executable
        into <code>/usr/local/bin</code>, or any other directory of
        your choice.  We call this
        directory <code>$S3270_HOME</code>.  To build s3270 under
        Windows, we recommend
        the <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> environment.
        Link s3270 statically and place both <code>s3270.exe</code>
        and <code>cygwin1.dll</code>
        into <code>$S3270_HOME</code>.  (There may
        be other ways to do it, but the above is the procedure we
        actually verified.).

        <li>Unpack h3270 into a directory of your choice.  We call
        this directory <code>$H3270_HOME</code>.</li>

        <li>If you placed s3270 into a directory other
        than <code>/usr/local/bin</code>, change
        the <code>exec-path</code> entry in the
        file <code>$H3270_HOME/webapp/WEB-INF/h3270-config.xml</code>.
        It must contain the directory where you put the s3270 binary
        (not the name of the binary itself).

        <li>In <code>$H3270_HOME</code>, copy the
        file <code>build.properties.examples</code> to
        <code>build.properties</code> and make changes as necessary.
        You <i>must</i> at least change <code>servlet.jar</code> to
        point to a jar file that contains the Servlet API.  In Tomcat,
        this file can be found
        under <code>$TOMCAT_HOME/common/lib/servlet-api.jar</code>.
        If you want to use h3270 as a portlet, you must also change
        the entry <code>portlet-api.jar</code> so that it points to a
        jar file with the Porlet API classes.  If this entry is not
        present or not correct, h3270 still builds without
        problems, but the portlet is not compiled.  The other entries
        in <code>build.properties</code>are optional.</li>

        <li>Type <code>ant war</code> to build the h3270 web archive.
        The resulting file will be called <code>h3270.war</code>.</li>

        <li>Deploy <code>h3270.war</code> to your web container or
        portlet container.  In Tomcat, simply copy the file
        to <code>$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps</code>.  In Jetspeed, copy it
        to <code>WEB-INF/deploy</code> within the Jetspeed web
        application.  Most other containers have a similar, simple
        deployment procedure (see below for some notes on specific
        containers).</li>

        <li>If you use Tomcat, start it and point your browser
        to <code>http://localhost:8080/h3270/servlet</code>.  If you
        use a Portlet container, start it and log in to the portal.
        You will need to use the administration facilities of the
        portal to place the portlet onto a page.  The portlet is
        called "H3270Portlet".</li>

        <li>For details on how to use the h3270 user interface, please
        refer to the 
        <a href="userguide.html">H3270&nbsp;User&nbsp;Guide</a>.</li>
      </ol>

      <h1>Notes on some Portal Servers</h1>

      <ul class="installation-list">
        <li><b>Liferea Portal Server 4.0</b> A special deployment
        descriptor, <code>liferea-portlet.xml</code> is needed for
        Liferea.  It is included in the WEB-INF directory of h3270.
        </li>

        <li><b>IBM WebSphere Portal Server (WPS) 5.1</b> You may have
        to uncomment the taglib declaration for the "portlet" library
        in <code>$H3270_HOME/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml</code>.  Other
        portal servers seem to do fine without it.
        <p>
        WPS uses an old version of the Apache Avalon framework which
        conflicts with the version shipped with h3270.  We have not
        been able to reconcile this via classloader settings, so for
        now we just recommend to <i>remove</i> the
        file <code>$WPS_HOME/shared/app/avalon-framework-cvs-20020806.jar</code>.
        This jar is apparently only used in one of IBM's factory
        portlets, and we have not been able to find out which.  If
        somebody runs into trouble because of this, or finds a better
        solution, let us know.
        </li>
