      <h1>Configuration</h1> 
      This page explains how to configure h3270's rendering engine,
      which allows you to transform your host applications from a
      character-based layout to the look and feel of a web
      application.  The rendering engine uses regular expressions as
      known from many programming tools and languages such as Perl and
      also Java.  In the following, we assume that you are basically
      familiar with regular expressions.  To learn about them, we
      recommend the book <a
      href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/regex2/">Mastering Regular
      Expressions</a> by Jeffrey Friedl.
      <p>
      The basic idea is that you provide an <i>HTML template page</i>
      (or short: <i>template</i>) for one or more host screens.  A
      template says how a particular screen (or a group of screens)
      should appear in HTML.  Each template consists of three parts:
      an <i>accept pattern</i>, a <i>match pattern</i>, and an <i>HTML
      body</i>.
      <ul>
        <li>The <b>accept pattern</b> is a regular expression that decides
        whether this template applies to a particular host screen.  It
        applies if the pattern matches the textual representation of
        the screen.</li>
        <p>
        <li>The <b>match pattern</b> is a regular expression that is used to
        parse relevant information from the host
        screen.  Text captured by <i>capturing groups</i> in this
        regular expression can later be inserted into the HTML body.</li>
        <p>
        <li>The <b>HTML body</b> is an ordinary HTML page that may
        contain special markers such as <i>#1, #2, #3</i>.  These
        special markers indicate where text captured by the <i>match
        pattern</i> should be inserted into the page.</li>
      </ul>
      Syntactically, the accept pattern and the match pattern are
      specified in two special HTML comments at the start of the
      template file.  (This means that you can edit and view the HTML
      part with any ordinary HTML tool.)  The structure is shown
      below: Both special comments must begin in the first column of
      the file, and include the reserved words <code>accept</code>
      resp. <code>match</code> in the indicated positions.  The
      regular expressions start in the following line and extend to
      the end of the comment, not including the final newline before
      the end-of-comment marker.  This marker also needs to go into
      the first column.  The rest of the template file, after the two
      special comments, is the HTML body (it needn't be
      in <code>&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;</code> tags).
      <p>
      <center>
      <pre class=codex style="width:40em;"><span style="color:red;">&lt;!-- accept</span>

    <i>Accept Pattern Here</i>

<span style="color:red;">--&gt;</span>

<span style="color:blue;">&lt;!-- match</span>

    <i>Match Pattern Here</i>

<span style="color:blue;">--&gt;</span>

<span style="color:green;">&lt;html&gt;</span>

    <i>HTML Body Here</i>

<span style="color:green;">&lt;/html&gt;</span></pre>
      </center>
      <p>
      When h3270 starts up, the rendering engine initializes itself by
      reading all template files from the
      directory <code>WEB-INF/templates</code> within the h3270 web
      application.  Template files look like ordinary HTML files,
      with the same extension, <code>.html</code>.  When a particular
      host screen is encountered by h3270, it tries all the accept
      patterns of the template pages it has found in the above
      directory against the textual representation of the host
      screen.  The first template that matches is selected to render
      the screen.  (You can find some example templates included
      within the <code>templates</code> directory of the h3270 distribution.)
      <p>
      The <b>accept pattern</b> is an ordinary regular expression,
      which is applied to the host screen in JDK standard mode with no
      optional flags.  The pattern only needs to match somewhere
      inside the host screen, not the entire screen.  In the textual
      representation against which the pattern is matched, screen
      lines are terminated with newline characters (which correspond
      naturally to newlines in the pattern).  Input fields in the host
      screen are marked by "{" and "}" characters (these appear in the
      exact positions where the field attributes were in the original
      host screen).
      <p>
      The <b>match pattern</b> is applied to the screen after the
      corresponding accept pattern was found to match.  Unlike the
      accept pattern, the match pattern is applied in DOTALL mode
      (where "." matches everything, including a newline), because
      that is more convenient in the match pattern.  You can change
      this by switching DOTALL mode off inside the pattern with
      "<code>(?-s)</code>".  The match pattern needn't match the entire screen,
      only part of it, but it is an error if the match pattern
      does <i>not</i> match the screen at all after the accept
      pattern has succeeded.
      <p>
      Within the match pattern, you can use capturing groups
      (parenthesized subexpressions) to capture text from the host
      screen for later insertion into the HTML body.  If you
      want to include an <i>input field</i> from the host screen
      within the rendered HTML page, you <i>must</i> match this input
      field within a capturing group.  The result must be a capturing
      group that starts and ends with "{" and "}" characters; such
      groups are recognized and handled specially by the engine.
      Thus, a common expression to match and capture an input field is
      "<code>(\{.*?\})</code>".  (This uses a non-greedy asterisk so
      that the match doesn't run off beyond the terminating "}".)
      <p>
      Within the <b>HTML body</b>, you can use placeholders such
      as <i>#1, #2, #3</i> for text that was captured by corresponding
      groups of the match pattern.  To include a literal "&#035;" character
      in your HTML page, write it as <code>&amp;#035;</code> (the hash
      mark inside this expression is not counted as a placeholder
      because it comes after an "<code>&amp;</code>").  If the
      text that was captured by a particular group is enclosed in "{"
      and "}" characters, an HTML input field for the corresponding
      host screen field will be generated.
      <p>
      As an additional feature, you can write a qualified Java class
      name within braces after a placeholder, such as
      "<code>#1{org.h3270.render.ParagraphFilter}</code>".  This means
      that before the captured text is placed into the HTML page, it
      is run through the <code>filter()</code> method of an instance
      of the specified class, which must implement the
      interface <code>org.h3270.render.Filter</code>.  You can use
      this to make arbitrary modifications to the text captured from
      the host screen before it gets into the HTML page.  As an
      example, the above <code>ParagraphFilter</code> finds empty
      lines within the text and replaces them with HTML &lt;p&gt;
      tags.
