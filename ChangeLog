	* h3270 version 1.2-pre1 released.

	The character-based terminal emulation has been improved.
	It now supports colors and true multi-line fields.  The Web GUI
	has a new "Preferences" dialog that allows you to choose between
	several predefined color schemes, choose a font, and control
	the regex rendering engine.

	* h3270 version 1.1 released.

	Handle the case when a field starts in the last column of
	the previous line (as it happens on the standard z/OS login
	screen...)

	Changes to handle invisible fields, suggested by
	Michael Ervin <symphyl@yahoo.com>.
